# The Leanpub Academy Course Template

This template is meant to be used bu authors who are invited to create courses for Leanpub Academy.

If this is your first time making a Leanpub course, we recommend you watch this comprehensive tutorial video: [https://youtu.be/unLz6zYaryE](https://youtu.be/unLz6zYaryE).

In the video, we show you everything you need to know to make your first Leanpub course.

The video shows a course being created in the Browser writing mode. Things obviously work a bit differently if you're using the GitHub (recommended!) or the Dropbox writing mode to create your course, but the way you actually write the course in Markua, and the way you set it up on our website and generate previews, is the same. 

We're writing this course in a single file, but you can write in multiple text files if you want to!

If you are using the GiyHub or Dropbox writing mode, your text files all need to be saved in the `manuscript` folder. If you do create muliple files, make sure to list all the filenames, in the order you want them to appear, in the Book.txt file.

If you ever have any questions or run into any issues, please email the team at hello@leanpub.com, and mention "Leanpub Academy Support Request" in the subject line. Including a link to your course in the email will really help speed things up!

Thank you for being part of Leanpub Academy!
